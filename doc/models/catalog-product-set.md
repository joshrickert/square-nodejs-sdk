# Catalog Product Set

Represents a collection of catalog objects for the purpose of applying a
`PricingRule`. Including a catalog object will include all of its subtypes.
For example, including a category in a product set will include all of its
items and associated item variations in the product set. Including an item in
a product set will also include its item variations.

Any<br>number of these catalog objects can be in an order for a pricing rule to apply.<br><br>This can be used with `product_ids_all` in a parent `CatalogProductSet` to<br>match groups of products for a bulk discount, such as a discount for an<br>entree and side combo.<br><br>Only one of `product_ids_all`, `product_ids_any`, or `all_products` can be set.<br><br>Max: 500 catalog object IDs. |

| `quantityExact` | `bigint \| undefined` | Optional | If set, there must be exactly this many items from `products_any` or `products_all`<br>in the cart for the discount to apply.<br><br>Cannot be combined with either `quantity_min` or `quantity_max`. |
| `quantityMin` | `bigint \| undefined` | Optional | If set, there must be at least this many items from `products_any` or `products_all`<br>in a cart for the discount to apply. See `quantity_exact`. Defaults to 0 if<br>`quantity_exact`, `quantity_min` and `quantity_max` are all unspecified. |
| `quantityMax` | `bigint \| undefined` | Optional | If set, the pricing rule will apply to a maximum of this many items from<br>`products_any` or `products_all`. |
